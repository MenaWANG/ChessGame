### Computer Opponent Levels

#### Easy Mode
- **Thinking Time:** 3 seconds
- **Characteristics:**
  - Basic material counting
  - Simple tactical awareness
  - High randomization (50% factor)
  - Focus on immediate captures
- **Technical Implementation:**
  - **Material Evaluation:**
    - Pure piece values without context
    - Basic capture evaluation (MVV-LVA)
    - No positional bonuses
    - Simple piece mobility (+5 points per legal move)
  - **Move Selection:**
    - Evaluates immediate captures first
    - Considers basic piece development
    - Random selection from top 5 moves
    - No lookahead/depth search
  - **Randomization:**
    - 50% chance to select sub-optimal moves
    - Helps simulate beginner-level play
    - Avoids obvious blunders
- **Example Position:**
```
8 ‚ôú . . ‚ôõ ‚ôö ‚ôù . ‚ôú
7 ‚ôü ‚ôü ‚ôü . . ‚ôü ‚ôü ‚ôü
6 . . ‚ôû . . ‚ôû . .
5 . . . ‚ôü ‚ôü . . .

3 . . . . . . . .
2 ‚ôô ‚ôô ‚ôô . . ‚ôô ‚ôô ‚ôô
1 ‚ôñ ‚ôò ‚ôó ‚ôï ‚ôî . ‚ôò ‚ôñ
```
In this position, Easy mode:
- Recognizes the basic material count is even
- Sees immediate captures (if any)
- Considers simple piece development
- May miss tactical opportunities like pins or forks
- Focuses on single-move threats

#### Medium Mode
- **Thinking Time:** 2 seconds
- **Characteristics:**
  - Material evaluation with context
  - Position-based decision making
  - Moderate randomization (20% factor)
  - Basic opening principles
- **Technical Implementation:**
  - **Position Evaluation:**
    - Material counting with basic positional context
    - Center control bonus (+5 points per central square)
    - Basic pawn structure evaluation
      - Doubled pawns (-10 points)
      - Isolated pawns (-10 points)
    - Simple king safety assessment
      - Castling bonus (+30 points)
      - Pawn shield evaluation (+5 per protecting pawn)
  - **Opening Knowledge:**
    - Basic development principles
    - Simple center control strategy
    - King safety consideration
  - **Tactical Awareness:**
    - Identifies basic combinations
    - Recognizes common patterns
    - Limited positional sacrifices
- **Example Position:**
```
8 . . . ‚ôú . ‚ôú ‚ôö .
7 ‚ôü . . . . ‚ôü ‚ôü ‚ôü
6 . ‚ôü . . . ‚ôû . .
5 . . . ‚ôù ‚ôü . . .

- Material balance (equal material)
- Piece coordination (knight and bishop positioning)
- Basic pawn structure assessment
- King safety evaluation
- Control of central squares
- Potential piece exchanges

#### Hard Mode
- **Thinking Time:** 1 second
- **Characteristics:**

  - **Positional Understanding:**
    - Center control (both central and extended center)
    - Piece mobility and coordination
    - Advanced pawn structure evaluation
    - Sophisticated king safety assessment
  - **Opening Principles:**
    - Prioritizes piece development
    - Strong center control (+10 points per central square)
